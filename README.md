# boulder-tracker

This is a full stack web development application that keeps track of the bouldering problems that I have either completed or are still working on. 

In the backend, I use the Express.js framework along with MySQL to manage the databases. 

In the frontend, I use React to build the UI.

### Available Features
- Adding a new boulder problem to the database
- Deleting existing boulder problems from the database
- Sorting boulder problems by various categories

### Future Plans and Improvements
You can check out the [Issues tab](https://github.com/jamiema1/boulder-tracker/issues) to see what ideas I will be working on.
