# boulder-tracker-v1

This is the first iteration of my full stack web development application that keeps track of the bouldering problems that I have either completed or are still working on. The production version of this project can be viewed [here](https://jamiema1.github.io/boulder-tracker-v1/). Please note that features involving manipulating the database (add, remove, update) have been disabled for the production version. If you would like to see a demonstration of those features, please notify me and I would be more than happy to show that to you!

### To create the project, I used . . . 
- Express.js framework along with MySQL to manage the backend
- React to build the frontend
- GitHub Pages for the frontend deployment
- Amazon Web Services to host the server, APIs and database

### Available Features
- Adding a new boulder problem to the database
- Deleting and updating existing boulder problems from the database
- Sorting and filtering boulder problems by various categories

### Future Plans and Improvements
You can always check out the [Issues tab](https://github.com/jamiema1/boulder-tracker/issues) to see what ideas I will be working on and have planned for the future.
